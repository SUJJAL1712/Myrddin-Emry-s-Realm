# Game Description

Myrddin Emry's Realm is a one-player, text-based fantasy game using object-oriented programming concepts. The character, Myrddin Emrys, starts just to the north of Town in the Darkwood Forest. The player can move north, south, east or west depending on the available path through the forest. Myrddin will encounter locked doors, items, healing potions, and eventually a Red Dragon. Myrddin can fight with either his fists or with the use of a longbow to shoot arrows.

# Game Flow

In this adventure game, the player is presented with a choice at the start to either enter the game or exit it. Upon entering the game, the player is placed in the extreme south of the map and can choose to travel in any direction. As the player moves through the map, they encounter rooms marked with different letters: 'I', 'M', and 'L'.

Rooms marked with 'I' contain collectable items such as healing potions or keys, while rooms marked with 'M' have monsters that the player must defeat to proceed further. Rooms marked with 'L' are locked, and the player will need to find the key to unlock them and move ahead.

The player has a variety of options to choose from during the game, such as picking up an item with the 'g' key, quitting the game with the 'q' key, dropping an item with the 'd' key, unlocking a door with the 'u' key, using a healing potion with the 'dr' key, viewing their stats and inventory with the 'stats' key, and opening the command menu with the 'help' key.

At the end of the map, the player encounters a Red Dragon, the final enemy in the game. To win the game, the player must defeat the dragon using their fists or shooting arrows. If the player is successful in defeating the dragon, an outro message is displayed, and the game ends. However, if the player fails to defeat the dragon, the game restarts, and they must try again.

Run the game using the command,

./TextGameCpp

We believe the suggested coding requirements are fullfilled through the game flow and features we have described above.
